# Hide Blocked Messages
This repository is for those looking to hide the "1 blocked message - show message" messages from discord. If reading this far into the future, please note that this may not work, so don't complain to me if it stops working.
<br>
<br>
## New userscript (tested with Violentmonkey)
Install userscript: https://github.com/Multarix/Discord-Hide-Blocked-Messages/raw/master/script.user.js
<br>
<br>

Some things to note:
- The "new message" banner will still appear.
- Blocked messages will not disappear instantly, but within half a second of them being posted.
- This does not delete them from the channel, server or any such action. It simply hides the message client side. Other people can still see the messages.
- If you wish to unblock the person, the sidebar or your block list in the friends area is the best option.
